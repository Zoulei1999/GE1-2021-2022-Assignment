# GE1-2021-2022-Assignment
I want to make a game that is procedurally generated, in which a player looks for items or dodges object,
or make a game that is a platformer, kind of like jump king.


After coding my assignment i found it difficult for to implement the moving tiles for a patformer.  an example of what i wanted was like in super mario.
but this was too difficule for me to implement and because of that i had to cut some of my initial ideas.

I got the procedurial generation complete and when i run the game the level is different every time.

Added in a few differnet scripts to enchance the experience of the game.
