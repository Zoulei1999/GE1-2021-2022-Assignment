# Description of the project
The project is based on a procedurially generated platformer. The game is very simple as it is the first game i have ever made.

# Instructions for use
Movement of the player is done using [WASD].
Jumping is done with [SPACE].
Camera rotation is done with mouse[X AND Y axis].

# How it works
The player is dropped in a world surrounded by four walls and the player must find chest and collect them before the time ends.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
Getting the game completed itself, was something that i am very proud of as i never made a game by myself and because of that i tried my best with the limited knowledge i have.

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
I want to make a game that is procedurally generated, in which a player looks for items or dodges object,
or make a game that is a platformer, kind of like jump king.
